# Data Structures and Algorithms using Python

A comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Python for educational purposes.

## About

This project serves as a learning resource for understanding and implementing classic data structures and algorithms. Each implementation focuses on:

- **Clean, readable code** with proper type hints
- **Pythonic idioms** and best practices
- **Educational value** over micro-optimizations

Whether you're preparing for coding interviews, studying computer science fundamentals, or just curious about how things work under the hood, this repository is for you.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher (uses modern type hints syntax)
- No external dependencies required

## How to Run

### Running a specific algorithm

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd data_structures_and_algorithms_using_python

# Run a sorting algorithm
python -m sorting_algorithms.interchange_sort
python -m sorting_algorithms.selection_sort
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can help:

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-algorithm`)
3. **Commit** your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing algorithm'`)
4. **Push** to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-algorithm`)
5. **Open** a Pull Request
